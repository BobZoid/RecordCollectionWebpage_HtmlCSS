        "Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?" is an album that deserves to be remembered, because it has never valued at its fair measure. Maybe the beginnings of this band were a bit turbulent, with continuous lineup changes, or because their masterpieces "Rust In Peace" and "Countdown To Extinction" overshadow this legacy. This seems a grievance because Megadeth is a band to rediscover, regardless of their three popular albums (including "Youthanasia"). This record has a very strong point, all songs here are quite unpredictable. They're not your typical radio singles, even the singles that accompany it.

        "Wake Up Dead" is a masterful opener, with rhythm changes, complex developments, with an effective hook that works well with peculiar vocals, speed guitar solos, and an omnipresent bass with lyrics politically incorrect. Yeah, fuck the political correctness. "The Conjuring", with superb Ellefson's bass lines shows that he's one of the pillars that support the band's sound. The title track is a super hit, its speech worthy of study shows the songwriting that would impress again in Countdown To Extinction. If I summarize all in a song, would be this one, since it gathers the basic details on these songs, such as refined technique, insurmountable riff and jazz reminiscences. "Devil's Island" closes the first half, one of my favorite sides in thrash metal. Ever. "My Last Words" is another great song with Iron Maiden influence, a perfect way to end this masterpiece, maybe it follows the custom of that British band.
